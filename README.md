EFENet: Reference-based Video Super-Resolution with Enhanced Flow Estimation

Code is a bit messy now. I woud clean up soon.

For training the EFENet using the warping and fusion strategy proposed in our paper, run ./qsub_train_exp18.sh

For CrossNet with other warping and fusion strategies to perform reference-based video super-resolution (RefVSR), refer to other running file like "qsub_train_[id instead of 18].sh". More details would be given soon to distiguish each of those strategies.
